#About
This calendar leaves you lots of possibilities:
You can choose between different settings:
* Start weekday
* Show the last / first days of the month before / after?
* Show the days from 1 to 9 with a leading zero?
* and much more

You can give the calendar completely your own style!

#Simple integration
There are only two little things you've to do.


First you must link to the JavaScript files:
```
<script src="javascript/jquery-1.11.3.min.js"></script>
<script src="javascript/calendar.js"></script>
```


After that, you need to insert the div container into your website, in which the JavaScript code will load the calendar:
```
<div id="treadar-calendar"></div>
```

You'll find a German translated example configuration on *calendar/config/calendar_data_german.json*.
